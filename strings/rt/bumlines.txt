I hate this place.
Can't have a shit in Panopticon.
Tear Roguetown down again.
I hope that Mortelg gonna fucking fall.
Give me money...
Give me food...
I'm so hungry...
I'm starving...
I hate that guy.
Worthless town.
Worthless life.
I wish I was home. They were supposed to protect us.
I saw necronox over the town.
I looked up at the moon, and here I am.
You are a dog. You will die like one too.
Another afternoon...
Fog?
The fog.
